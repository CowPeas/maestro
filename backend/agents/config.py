    1. System components and their interactions
    2. Data flows and dependencies
    3. Security boundaries and trust zones
    4. External integrations and APIs
    5. Authentication and authorization mechanisms
    Format your output as structured JSON.""",

    based on the MAESTRO framework's seven layers. For each identified component or interaction, analyze:
    1. Foundation Models: Model vulnerabilities, training data issues, prompt injection
    2. Data Operations: Data leakage, poisoning, privacy concerns
    3. Agent Frameworks: API security, authentication flaws, rate limiting
    4. Deployment: Infrastructure security, network vulnerabilities
    5. Evaluation: Monitoring gaps, logging issues
    6. Security: Compliance gaps, access control issues
    7. Ecosystem: Multi-agent interaction risks, coordination failures
    Provide detailed threat descriptions with potential impact.""",
