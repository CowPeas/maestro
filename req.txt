Technical Design Document: MAESTRO-Based Agentic AI Threat Modeling Tool
1. Introduction to MAESTRO
MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat, Risk, and Outcome) is a threat modeling framework specifically designed for Agentic AI systems. It addresses the unique challenges of AI agents that can autonomously make decisions, interact with external tools, and adapt over time. Unlike traditional frameworks, MAESTRO uses a seven-layer architecture to systematically identify and mitigate threats across the AI lifecycle. These layers include:
1. Foundation Models: Core AI models like GPT-4 or custom LLMs.
2. Data Operations: Data storage, processing, and vector embeddings.
3. Agent Frameworks: APIs and software enabling agent creation and interaction.
4. Deployment and Infrastructure: Hosting environments like servers and networks.
5. Evaluation and Observability: Tools for monitoring and debugging agent behavior.
6. Security and Compliance: Measures to ensure system protection and regulatory adherence.
7. Agent Ecosystem: Multi-agent environments where agents collaborate or compete.
Purpose of the Tool
The tool will act as an autonomous Agentic AI system powered by large language models (LLMs). It will:
· Analyze system architecture diagrams, documents, or product descriptions.
· Automatically identify threats based on the MAESTRO framework.
· Classify threats into High, Medium, or Low categories based on risk assessment.
· Provide a frontend for threat lifecycle management (e.g., Open → In Progress → Resolved).
· Store threats, mitigations, and their statuses in a PostgreSQL database.
2. System Overview
Key Capabilities
1. Autonomous Threat Identification:
o Uses LLMs to analyze input data (e.g., architecture diagrams) and generate threats based on MAESTRO layers.
o Supports multiple LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT models or fine-tuned open-source models).
2. Threat Classification:
o Automatically assigns risk levels (High/Medium/Low) based on likelihood and impact.
3. Lifecycle Management:
o Tracks the status of threats from identification to mitigation.
4. Scalable Storage:
o Uses PostgreSQL with vector storage (PgVector) for efficient threat retrieval.
5. User Interface:
o Provides a dashboard for visualizing threats, managing statuses, and generating reports.
3. Implementation Details
3.1 Frontend
Technology Stack
· Framework: React.js with TypeScript for type safety.
· State Management: Redux or Context API.
· Styling: TailwindCSS or Material-UI.
Features
1. Dashboard:
o Displays threats by MAESTRO layers.
o Provides risk matrices (likelihood × impact) for prioritization.
2. Threat Details Page:
o Shows detailed threat descriptions, classifications, and mitigation plans.
3. Threat Lifecycle Management:
o Allows users to update threat statuses (e.g., Open → Resolved).
4. Search & Filter:
o Enables filtering by layer, classification, or status.
3.2 Backend
Technology Stack
· Programming Language: Python.
· Framework: FastAPI for building RESTful APIs.
Key Components
1. LLM Integration:
o Use LangChain to interact with LLMs for threat generation.
o Support multiple LLMs by dynamically selecting models via configuration files.
2. Threat Classification Logic:
o Implement risk assessment using predefined metrics for likelihood (1–5) and impact (1–5).
3. Agent Orchestration:
o Use LangChain’s ReAct loop or LangGraph for multi-agent collaboration (e.g., one agent parses input data while another generates threats).
3.3 Database
Technology Stack
· PostgreSQL with PgVector extension for vectorized storage of LLM-generated embeddings.
Schema Design
CREATE TABLE threats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    classification VARCHAR(10) CHECK (classification IN ('High', 'Medium', 'Low')),
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('Open', 'In Progress', 'Resolved')),
    layer VARCHAR(50),
    likelihood INT CHECK (likelihood BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    impact INT CHECK (impact BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    embedding VECTOR(768), -- Vector storage for LLM embeddings
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE mitigations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    threat_id INT REFERENCES threats(id),
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('Pending', 'Completed')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('Admin', 'Analyst'))
);


3.4 LLM-Oriented Workflow
1. Input Processing:
o Users upload architecture diagrams or documents via the frontend.
o Backend converts these into structured text using OCR or NLP preprocessing tools like spaCy.
2. Threat Generation:
o Backend sends processed input to an LLM agent via LangChain’s API wrapper.
o The agent generates potential threats aligned with MAESTRO layers.
3. Threat Classification:
o A secondary agent evaluates likelihood and impact scores to classify threats.
4. Threat Storage:
o Threats are stored in PostgreSQL along with their vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.
5. Mitigation Suggestions:
o The tool uses another LLM agent to propose mitigations for identified threats.
3.5 Agent Design
Multi-Agent Collaboration
Leverage LangGraph or Microsoft Autogen to orchestrate agents with distinct roles:
1. Input Parser Agent:
o Extracts key details from uploaded documents/diagrams.
2. Threat Generator Agent:
o Identifies threats using MAESTRO’s layered framework.
3. Risk Assessor Agent:
o Assigns likelihood and impact scores based on predefined metrics.
4. Mitigation Planner Agent:
o Suggests actionable mitigation steps for each threat.
